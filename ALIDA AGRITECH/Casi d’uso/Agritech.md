### Case Overview

As part of a project within the National Recovery and Resilience Plan
(PNRR), there is a need for a use case to train a model that, based on
the movements of a cow (monitored through an IoT collar), validates
whether the growth occurs outdoors or indoors in a stable.

In addition to creating the ML model and managing its entire lifecycle,
ALIDA will also validate satellite data on a blockchain and provide
analytical results to a traceability system that will expose the outcome
during the scanning phase of the QR code displayed on the finished
product.

### Zooming into Project

In the context of an \*\*Agritech\*\* project, ALIDA can offer tools and
methods to efficiently manage and analyze large amounts of agricultural
data. Here's how you could use ALIDA in an Agritech project (*Figure
2.9.3: Agritech Contribution 01*):

1.  Data Collection and Preprocessing

ALIDA can assist in collecting data from various sources such as IoT
sensors, satellite images, and existing databases. Additionally, it
provides tools for data preprocessing:

- Data Cleaning: Removing missing or anomalous data.

- Data Normalization: Adjusting data to ensure uniformity.

- Data Integration: Combining data from different sources.

2.  Data Analysis

ALIDA offers numerous algorithms for analyzing agricultural data:

- Statistical Analysis: To understand trends in crop yield data, climate
  data, etc.

- Predictive Analysis: Using machine learning models to predict crop
  yields, plant diseases, and other relevant metrics.

- Spatial Analysis: For analyzing geographic data, such as land maps and
  crop distribution.

3.  Data Visualization

Effectively visualizing data is crucial for making informed decisions.
ALIDA provides tools to create:

- Interactive Charts: To dynamically explore data.

- Thematic Maps: To visualize crop distribution, soil moisture, and
  other geospatial variables.

- Customized Dashboards: To monitor key metrics in real-time.

4.  Process Automation

In the context of Agritech, automation can increase efficiency:

- Automated Data Collection: Using sensors and drones to collect data
  automatically.

- Automated Analysis: Configuring analysis pipelines that automatically
  perform predictive analyses on new data.

- Automated Decision-Making: Implementing decision support systems that
  use analysis results to suggest actions.

5.  Specific Applications

    - Crop Monitoring: Using sensor data and satellite images to monitor
      crop health and identify issues early.

    - Irrigation Management: Analyzing soil moisture data and weather
      forecasts to optimize water use.

    - Crop Planning: Using predictive models to plan crop rotation and
      maximize yields.

    - Pest Management: Analyzing data to predict and prevent pest
      infestations.

### Alida in the Project

Example of Using ALIDA in an Agritech Project

Imagine an Agritech project aiming to optimize corn production. Here's
how you could use ALIDA:

1.  Data Collection:

Collect data from soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
satellite images.

2.  Preprocessing:

Clean and normalize the data to ensure quality.

3.  Predictive Analysis:

Use machine learning algorithms to predict corn yields based on future
weather conditions.

4.  Visualization:

Create maps and charts showing yield predictions and water stress
areas.

5.  Automation:

Implement a system that sends notifications to farmers when it's time
to irrigate or fertilize based on predictions and real-time data.

In conclusion, ALIDA can be a powerful tool in an Agritech project,
offering advanced functionalities for data collection, analysis,
visualization, and automation to improve agricultural efficiency and
productivity.
