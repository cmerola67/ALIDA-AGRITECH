### Case Overview

The European aviation industry faces a surge of multi-source and
multi-lingual data. The EU-funded ICARUS project will build a novel data
value chain in aviation-related sectors aimed at data-driven innovation
and collaboration across industry players. Using methods such as big
data analytics, deep learning, semantic data enrichment and
blockchain-powered data sharing, ICARUS aims to develop a multi-sided
platform allowing integration and deep analysis of data for EU-based
companies, organisations and scientists. ICARUS will bring together the
aerospace, tourism, health, security, transport, retail, weather and
public sectors and accelerate their data-driven collaboration.

### Zooming into Project

Industries of all types are using the power of big data and analytics to
fundamentally transform how they do business. The notable exception is
the aviation industry. In fact, there is currently little data diffusion
and sharing between the different stakeholders of the aviation-related
sectors.

"The European aviation industry needs to leverage the surge of
multisource data in order to gain augmented intelligence and open the
door to a range of unprecedented services," says Dimitrios Alexandrou,
business innovation director at UBITECH, a Greek technology company.

With a focus on building a data value chain, the EU-funded ICARUS
(Aviation driven Data Value Chain for Diversified Global and Local
Operations) project is helping the aviation industry embrace data-driven
innovation. "Using big data analytics, deep learning, data enrichment,
and blockchain-powered data sharing, the ICARUS project aims to deliver
a unique data and intelligence platform for the aviation industry," adds
Alexandrou, who serves as the project coordinator.

A one-stop shop for aviation data and intelligence The objective of the
project

is to conceptualise, design and develop the ICARUS platform. When
finalised, the platform will enable data exploration,
blockchain-empowered sharing, and the brokerage of a large variety of
heterogeneous data sources. It will also serve as a one stop shop for
aviation data and intelligence -- covering the entire big data
lifecycle, from data collection to curation, exploration, integration
and analysis.

"The platform will provide users with a deeper understanding of, for
example, flight optimisation, pollution awareness, tourism operations,
the passenger experience -- even how aviation can cause an epidemic to
spread," explains Alexandrou. "As such, it will be an invaluable tool
for the aviation industry, aviation-related service providers, and other
cross-sectoral stakeholders."

The platform will also serve as a trusted and secure sandbox-style
workspace where users can conduct analytical experiments in a safe and
confidential closedlab environment. "The ICARUS platform aims to address
the security and privacy concerns that have made the aviation industry
and related industries reluctant to leverage big data technologies,"
notes Alexandrou.

According to him, the platform has already received expressions of
interest from a number of external stakeholders.

Enabling data-driven innovation and collaboration Despite some delays
caused by COVID-19, the ICARUS project succeeded in creating a platform
that enables data-driven innovation and collaboration across the
aviation sector.

"The ICARUS platform effectively addresses the industry's reluctance to
explore, curate, share, trade, integrate and deeply analyse big data in
a trusted and fair manner," concludes Alexandrou. "In other words, it
provides the big data that will drive the design and implementation of
the innovative new services that will disrupt the aviation industry."

The platform will soon be available in beta format. Project researchers
are currently exploring the best business plan for bringing the platform
to market.
