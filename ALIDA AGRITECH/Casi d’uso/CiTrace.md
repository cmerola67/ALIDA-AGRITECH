### Overview

The CiTrace project proposes a reinterpretation of the concept of
traceability in the Agrifood sector, offering a data-centric solution
that views the product as an Information Vector along the entire
production chain, from the field to the final consumer.

This Information Vector progressively enriches its informational content
by leveraging all available information sources continuously. Applied to
the citrus supply chain, the CiTrace solution acts as a concentrator of
harmonized information, on which a set of Value-Added Services and
specific tools can be built for the different phases of the supply
chain, benefiting all involved stakeholders.

### Zooming into Project

In the context of an agri-food project, Alida will be used to provide:

The Flexible and Optimal Pricing Strategy service is calculated
considering three main indicators: production cost, selling price, and
brand reputation. Once all necessary information and values are
obtained, the result of executing the pipeline is a dataset that
indicates the optimal and flexible pricing strategy.

Evaluating the shelf life of products along the supply chain through
mathematical models and Machine Learning algorithms, aiming to obtain a
trained model representing the added value of Dynamic Shelf-Life
Assessment.

In defining the optimal distribution strategy, a fundamental role is
played by analyzing data collected along the entire supply chain. This
service is obtained by calculating and combining three indices: market
penetration rate, inventory turnover, and order fulfilment. The Optimal
Distribution Strategy model will be the result of training a Machine
Learning algorithm based on these data.
