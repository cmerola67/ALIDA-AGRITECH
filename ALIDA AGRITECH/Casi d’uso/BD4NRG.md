### Case Overview

BD4NRG envisions to confront big data management challenges for the
energy sector, giving a competitive edge to the European stakeholders to
improve decision making and at the same time to open new market
opportunities.

### Zooming into Project

BD4NRG aims to enable an incremental decentralized energy data-driven
ecosystem and a collaborative data sovereignty driven ecosystem. The
goal is to unlock and exploit the economic potential of big data and
give to Energy Sector stakeholders, the opportunity to improve their
business operational performance.

To achieve this and to address the emerging challenges in big data
management, BD4NRG partners will develop, adapt, deliver and deploy a
distributed big data energy analytics framework - BD4NRG Framework,
consisting of:

- Several distributed intelligent collaborative federated nodes, the
  BD4NRGData Hubs

- A graphically enriched Open Modular Big Data Analytics Energy Toolbox

- A scalable big-data energy analytics environment

BD4NRG will combine DLTs/blockchain technologies with edge processing,
Federated Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, to operate the
data-driven energy ecosystem. Also, the project will make extensive
adoption of open sources technology components and tools and Open APIs.

The BD4NRG Framework will include 4 horizontal and 1 vertical (cyber
security) layer:

**Data Governance Layer**

A necessary middleware to act as a mediator between data users and data
providers who may want to decide case by case whether to disclose their
data or not. State of the art solutions to guarantee traceability,
provenance tracking and accountability but guaranteeing confidentiality
as well.

**Scalable Big Data Management & Processing Layer**

Smart management and processing of data by an intelligent information
broker. The content of multiple data sources, being generated, managed
and stored in the data management systems and the data hubs of the
different operators and actors by innovative components and technology
enablers.

**Applications Layer**

Analytics-centred applications tailoring power network improved
cross-functional decision-making to improve power network reliability,
optimize management of flexibility assets, address building-scale energy
efficient comfort management and dynamic situated renewable investment
risk assessment.

1.  Open Modular Smart Grid Big Data Analytics Toolbox: User-friendly
    with modern vision of the data analytics Toolbox, providing a
    working space for self-service capabilities that give autonomy to
    the end-user combining data that come from different sources.

2.  Data / Models / Resources Marketplace: A virtual workbench with a
    variety of assets, including data, third party services, machine
    learning models, computing resources and storage resources as
    tradable assets providing off the shelf tools, library of reusable
    AI-based machine learning models, external off-domain data sets and
    reusable data-driven analytics applications.

**Cyber Security - Data Privacy Layer**

A vertical layer to establish user authentication and authorisation to
secure the non-open data of the transaction as well as to comply with
the EC regulation on Data Protection

### Alida in the Project

BD4NRG aims to develop data analytics services capable to analyse data
in a seamless and holistic fashion, across multiple data sources. Among
the existing efforts analysed, ALIDA BDA platform has been selected as a
starting point for the BD4NRG Analytics Toolbox and it will be extended
and validated in the energy domain, according to the needs that emerged
in the requirements elicitation phase of the project. ALIDA embraces the
paradigm of BDA-as-a-service (BDAaaS). Besides relevant cost savings,
the provision of Big Data analytical capabilities using the cloud
delivery model could ease the adoption of the toolbox and could simplify
useful insights with different kinds of competitive advantage. BDAaaS
consists of as a set of automatic tools and methodologies that allows
users lacking Big Data expertise to manage BDA and deploy big data
pipeline applications ready-to-be-executed addressing their goals at
edge/fog/cloud nodes.

The ALIDA platform supports full orchestration of BDA application
workflows and allows for composition, deployment and execution of
workflows (either batch or stream) of BDA applications. *Figure 2.4.3*
describes the ALIDA general architecture.
